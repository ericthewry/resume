\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
  \item Developed temporal semantics for queries of graph data, defining what it

  \item Theorized temporal feature indexes to improve query times.
  \item Extended most performant algorithm, QuickSI, with explicit and implicit
  temporal verification  conditions.

  \item Implemented in C++ with tenfold efficiency improvements.
\end{itemize}
